                </ext-link>
                refers to the capabilities, features, solutions, etc. that are provided towards the consumer.
                We will define the consumers and their consumptions in the next steps.
            </p>
            <p>
                Give your service provider a name to be able to recognize it.
                The description is optional but can be useful to provide more context.
            </p>
            <p>
                A service is what the consumer interacts with. For example: an API endpoint may provide multiple capabilities that are used by the consumers to solve different use cases.

            <p>A service can be any of these types:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Automated</strong>: a service thatâ€™s fully automated using software/hardware</li>
                <li><strong>Manual</strong>: a manual service is either too expensive to automate or requires human intervention or judgement</li>
                <li><strong>Hybrid</strong>: a mix of both manual and automated</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Generally, the service levels are used for automated services but this categorization exists to signify that even the services that require manual effort can be measured and improved using service levels.
