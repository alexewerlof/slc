        <h1>Service Level Workshop</h1>
        <p>
            Measure the right metric by methodically identifying services, consumers, failures, risks, and metrics.

    <h1>Intro</h1>
    <p>
        This app helps you to systemmatically assess your services together with the consumers
        to identify proper Service Level Objectives.
    </p>
    <p>
        The UI is roughly broken into the following steps:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <button @click="currentStep = 1">{{ icon('provider') }} Providers</button>: Define the service providers
        </li>
        <li>
            <button @click="currentStep = 2">{{ icon('consumer') }} Consumers</button>: Define the consumers of the services
        </li>
        <li>
            <button @click="currentStep = 3">{{ icon('failure') }} Failures</button>: Define the failures that threaten the consumption of the services
        </li>
        <li>
            <button @click="currentStep = 4">{{ icon('risk') }} Risks</button>: Define the business impact of failures and sort them accordingly
        </li>
        <li>
            <button @click="currentStep = 5">{{ icon('metric') }} Metrics</button>: What to measure to proactively be on top of the risks?
        </li>
        <li>
            <button @click="currentStep = 6">Summary</button>: A summary of the assessment
        </li>
        <li>
            <button @click="currentStep = 7">Export</button>: Export the assessment to share with others
        </li>
    </ul>      
    <p>
        You can go back and forth between the tabs as you work your way through the UI.
    </p>
    <h2>Why failures?</h2>
    <p>
        There are many ways to approach service levels
        and there are even more pitfalls.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our approach is based on the following principles:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><em>No vanity metrics</em>: SLI describes reliability from the consumers' perspective. If an anomaly does not lead to a consumer facing failure and business risk, it is out of scope.</li>
        <li><em>Full ownership</em>: SLOs should tie to real commitments. The best way to implement commitments is to set alerts on the service level objectives</li>
        <li><em>Proper modeling</em>: have a clear meaning behind every word to build a common language.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Mental Model</h2>
    <p>
        The UI in this app is built using the following mental model:
    </p>

        <span class="exprs">Owner</span>

        <span class="exprs">Provider</span>(s).
