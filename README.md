# Code

Like most of my hobby projects, this repo wasn't meant to grow this big.
It started as a single page application to compensate some shortcomings
I faced when using [uptime.is](https://uptime.is) with these preconditions:

1. No transpilation whatsoever ([because](https://medium.com/free-code-camp/you-might-not-need-to-transpile-your-javascript-4d5e0a438ca))
2. Use the latest version of Vue (to learn it)
3. Run tests with Deno (to learn it)
4. Use Github Copilot assistence (to learn it)

And here we are.

## Thanks

* [iconoir](https://iconoir.com/) for open source icons.
* [Volvo Cars](https://www.volvocars.com/) employees for the feedback on the early versions of the product.
