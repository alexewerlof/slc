This project uses JavaScript and Vue.js version 3. The tests run in Deno.js environment

In JavaScript:

- Don't use semicolon
- Use single quote strings
- Always use `{...}` blocks even when the statement is short enough to fit in one line
- Use valid JSDoc documentation for exported entities: class, function, and properties
